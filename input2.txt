Hello my name is Ryan Mee. This is my 4th project in CSC 316. Here we have a spell checker.
It will read in a dictionary file and use it to create a hash table. The input file will then
be spell checked against that hash table and the results will be printed. Now I'm just writing
words that can be checked. This is for testing purposes so hopefully there are enough examples
so that there will be no suprises come grading. Let's test some apostrophes. The baker's cake
was baked in the oven until the clerk's customer was satisfied. Not all of these words will
be correctly checked of course. A word such as "freeer" is misspelled. But the checker will convert
it to "free" causing it to be missed. Many more words will be identified as misspelled when they are
in fact correct. That is because not all of the suffix rules are accounted for. This is a very
rudimentary program. Good luck!
