Project 4: Spell Checker
Author: Ryan Mee

Report:
    For this project I chose to implement a hash function that utilized the
    golden ratio method we discussed in class along with a polynomial hash code.
    This ensures that words with the same letters in different orders do not
    hash to the same value. Using the Golden Ratio will help keep the entries
    uniformly spread across the hash table.
    
    When the dictionary file is scanned each entry is stored as a string in an input 
    buffer while the number of entries is tracked. The hash table is created as an 
    array of Key objects with a size 1.3x that of the dictionary entries total. Key
    objects are linked lists used to store all entries that hash to that value.
    This is the method I used for collision resolution. When an entry is hashed
    to the same value as a previous entry, it is inserted at the end of that linked
    list. The first entry hashed to that value will become the head of the linked list.
    This creates buckets at each array index that hold all entries with that hash value.
